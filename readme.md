##TicTacToe Game

A TicTacToe game in CoffeeScript using Backbone.js TDD-ed with [jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node).

Just run 'npm install' to install the required node packages.

You need to tweak node_modules/backbone/backbone.js file to run the specs. Change the last line, remove the 'this' from call(this).

I submitted a pull request for this: https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/pull/840
